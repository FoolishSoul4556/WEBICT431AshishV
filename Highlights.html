        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <div class="columnL">
            <h3>Wineries and Restaurants</h3>
            <p>There are more than 55 wineries to choose from - offering cellar door sales, restaurants, cafes and tours. Along the way discover a foodie's paradise. Meet the growers, producers, providers and chefs. Experience the fun of picking your own produce or buying dinner ingredients at the farm gate. Dine with views of the sea, lakes and vineyards.</p>

            <h3>Golf</h3>
            <p>The Mornington Peninsula is blessed with 19 courses that both challenge and excite. Many golf courses provide the most exhilarating views over Port Philip Bay, Western Port and Bass Strait. The sand hiils and costal hinterland provide wonderful examples of links, resort and traditional courses. Visitors are always welcome.</p>

            <h3>Queenscliff-Sorrento Ferry</h3>
            <p>There's no better way to cross the Bay either with your car or as a foot passenger. It only takes 40 minutes. Spot the playful dolphins whilst enjoying a coffee and light refreshments. The ferries run every day of the year on the hour. Wonderful restaurants at historic Queenscliff on the Bellarine peninsula offer perfect lunchtime adventures.</p>

            <h3>Walking Tracks</h3>
            <p>Fabulous walking tracks in any direction for all ages. Beautiful beach walks, amazing cliff top strolls and for the more serious walkers, a 100km walk combines the Bay trial, National Parks and the two Bays walk through the hinterland.</p>

            <h3>Shopping Escapades</h3>
            <p>Lovely, leisurely shopping - for pure pleasure - is listed as the number one activity for holidaymakers.</p>
            <p>Sorrento and Mornington will not disappoint. Bookshops, giftware, home living and of course that odd handbag or "must have that" top is yours for the exploring.</p>
